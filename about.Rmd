We founded this club at the end of the 2016-2017 year in order to bring together students from all different disciplines through the complex problems present in the modern data fueled world. Our main goal as a club is learn more about data science together, and apply the knowledge we gain to various data centric problems. We are also committed to transforming this club into a competitive organization that partakes in data science university competitions.

If you are interested in mathematics, statistics, computer science, economics, finance, data science, or just solving interesting problems stop by and join the team.
