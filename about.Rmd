We founded this club at the end of the 2016-2017 year in order to bring together students from all different disciplines through the complex problems present in the financial world. Our main goal as a club is to build a trading platform that can be used to investigate relationships between various economic indicators. We are also committed to transforming this club into a competitive organization that partakes in finance and data science university competitions.

If you are interested in mathematics, statistics, computer science, economics, finance, data science, or just solving interesting problems stop by and join the team.
