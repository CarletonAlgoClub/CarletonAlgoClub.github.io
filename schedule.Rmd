We have not yet settled our Fall 2018 schedule, but during the 2017-2018 year we met on Saturday afternoons in the CMC.

We should have our fall term 2018 schedule settled by mid to late September. Weekly meeting updates will be sent out over email throughout the term. Please join our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/carleton.edu/forum/#!forum/carletonalgoclub.group "Join Our Google Group") to receive these scheduling updates.
