Merging projects is nearly impossible without Git so let's get it up and running and then learn the basics. 

#### __Install Git__

__OSX__

1. Install Homebrew if you don't already have it by running __ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"__ in the terminal

    + Check your brew installation with __brew doctor__

2. Install git with the command __brew install git__

__Linux__

1. Run __sudo apt-get install git__ in the terminal

__Windows__

1. Download and install git for windows [here](https://gitforwindows.org/)

Confirm your git installation with __git --version__

#### __Configure Git__

Now that you've got git installed you need to configure it to work with your GitHub. If you don't already have a GitHub account you can sign up for one [here](https://github.com/join "Join GitHub").

Configure your username and email with the following commands.

+ git config --global user.name "your_username"
+ git config --global user.email "your_account_email@email_host.com"

#### __Git Basics__

The first step to working with Git is to create a repository. You can create a repository on the GitHub webpage by navigating to the repository page and hitting the "New" button, or you can create a new directory and use the command __git init__.

If someone else has already created a repository as is often the case you can "clone" the repository to your machine using the command __git clone__ followed by the https address that is associated with a given repositroy. The https address associated with a repo can be found in the top right corner of a repository page as shown in the picture below.

Now that you've got a repository setup you can make changes to the project using the following commands.

+ __git add__
+ __git commit -m "your update message"__
+ __git push__
+ __git pull__

__git add <your_file>__ will add changes to a given file to a list of potential edits. __git add .__ will add all edits to all files in the repository to the list of potential edits. __git commit -m "update message"__ will commit those changes. __git push__ will push your changes to the repo. __git pull__ will pull changes others have made to the repo to your local copy of the repo. It is important to use __git pull__ frequently to avoid merge conflicts and help resolve them when they ultimately happen.

#### __Merge Conflicts__

It's quite likely that you'll encounter merge conflicts while working with Git on a regular basis, and while they can be quite frustrating they are not that difficult to fix. 

1. Update your repo using __git pull__

2. Try to merge your changes using the __git merge <repo_branch_you_are working from>__ command

    + If this fails make manual changes to your files as suggested by Git (these suggestions will be visible in the documents casuing the merge conflicts)
    
3. Use __git add__ and then __git merge__ to try and merge your changes

4. If you're still getting errors go back to step 1
