2. Run the downloaded __.exe__ file

__OSX__

1. Download R from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)

2. Run the downloaded __.pkg__ file

__Linux (Ubuntu)__

1. Run __sudo apt-get install r-base__ in the terminal

#### __Install R Studio__

__Windows__

1. Download R Studio from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

2. Run the downloaded __.exe__ file

__OSX__

1. Download R Studio from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

2. Run the downloaded __.dmg__ file

__Linux (Ubuntu)__

1. Run the following commands in the terminal

    + sudo apt-get install gdebi-core
    + wget https://download1.rstudio.org/rstudio-0.99.896-amd64.deb
    + sudo gdebi -n rstudio-0.99.896-amd64.deb
